Total Closed Banks: 553
Time Period: October 13, 2000 – June 27, 2025
Geographic Coverage: 44 states
Total Fund Involved: $6 million
Total Certificates: 18 million

Trends by Year
Closures peaked during the late 2000s/early 2010s, coinciding with the financial crisis.
Closures reduced in frequency after 2015, but there are still some bank failures in recent years (including in 2025).

Geographic Distribution
Top States for Bank Closures:
Georgia (GA): 93 closures (~17% of total)
Florida (FL): 76 closures (~14%)
Illinois (IL): 21 closures
Other significant states: Arizona (AZ), California (CA), Nevada (NV)
Cities with Highest Closures:
Chicago, IL: 21 closures
Atlanta, GA: 10 closures
Phoenix, AZ; Naples, FL; Alpharetta, GA; Bradenton, FL; Las Vegas, NV; Los Angeles, CA; Miami, FL; Scottsdale, AZ: Each with 4 or more closures.

Noteworthy Details
Majority of closures occurred before 2008 and in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis—with 27 closed before 2008 and 9 after 2020.
Some banks had no acquirer at closure, indicating complete liquidation.
Repeat Closures in Key Cities (Chicago, Atlanta, Phoenix) suggest regional banking vulnerabilities.

Observations
High Concentration in the Southeast US (notably Georgia and Florida).
Large urban centers like Chicago and Atlanta were especially impacted.
Roughly two-thirds of closures occurred during/after the 2008 financial crisis, fitting historical expectations.
Bank failures continue, though at a reduced rate, with some closures still occurring as late as June 2025.
Most cases had an acquiring institution, but several marked "No Acquirer" suggest total liquidation.
Conclusion:
Bank failures in the US have been concentrated in specific states and cities—especially Georgia, Florida, and Chicago, IL—with pronounced spikes during crisis periods. Although closures have slowed in recent years, they have not stopped entirely, indicating ongoing—albeit reduced—risk in parts of the US banking sector.
